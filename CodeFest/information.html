    <h3>Covid-19</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>What is it?</h4>
    <p>Covid-19 is the name of a disease from a coronavirus(SARS-CoV-2) that emerged in China in December 2019.</p>
    <p>Symptoms range from none to severe. These include: cough, fever or chills, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, muscle or body aches, sore throat, new loss of taste or smell, diarrhea, headache, new fatigue, nausea or vomiting and congestion or runny nose.  </p>
    <h4>How does it spread?</h4>
    <p>The virus is mainly spread through the air from an infected individual's breath, cough, sneeze, or speaking entering another individual's mouth, nose, or eyes. It may also spread from contaminated surfaces. Individuals are typically infectious for around two weeks.</p>
    <p>Factors that reduce the spread include wearing face masks, hand washing, ventilation, disinfecting surfaces, and self-isolation.</p>
    <h4>Do I have it?</h4>
    <p>Consider getting tested if you have any of the symptoms or have been in contact with someone with Covid-19 or in high risk activities like large gatherings/travel/indoor crowds.</p>

    <h4>Masks</h4>
    <p>Evidence supports that masks protect the individual wearing them and those around them. Other than neck gaiters/backlavas*, even the most basic coverings seem to more effective that not wearing anything. According to the CDC, those two years and older should wear masks in public settins and when around people outside of the household. Additionally, masks should also be worn when caring for someone sick with Covid-19. <br><br> The most protective masks are N95 and its equivalents(P2, KN95, KF94) which filter out large and small particles(>95% of small particles). Surgical and cloth masks are also protective and effective in filtering out large particles. The CDC recommends the public wear cloths masks made of 2+ layers of tightly woven cloth seen <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-to-make-cloth-face-covering.html">here</a>. <br>* <small>A recent found that neck gaiters made out of synthetic fibers may do more harm than good</small>

<div class="handwash">
    <h4>Hand Hygiene</h4>
    <p>Handwashing is and effective method to protect yourself against Covid-19 and other diseases. Through your hands alone, you can spread germs to yourself and others by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching your eyes/nose/mouth and other surfaces. Washing your hands frequently is important, but it is especially important before eating, after eating, coughing, sneezing, blowing your nose, and bathroom use. Washing your hands using soap and water for 20+ seconds is the most effective way to get rid of germs off our hands.<br><br> In the case of Covid-19, the molecules in soap disrupts the lipid membrane of the virus so that virus particle collapses and is no longer infectious. If washing your hands in not an option, using hand sanitzer is a good alternative. Hand sanitzers are not as effective if your hands are soiled or greasy. After applying hand sanitzer, rub your hands like when washing with soap and water for 20 seconds. Hand sanitizer should be around 60-95% alcohol to be effective.</p>

    <h4>Cleaning and Disinfecting</h4>
    <p>Coronavirus on surfaces naturally die within hours to days. A normal routine of cleaning with soap and water on dirty surfaces and or disinfectants lowers the risk of spreading germs like SARS-CoV-2. To get an idea of how long SARS-CoV-2 last on different surface we can see the results of <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2004973?query=featured_home">this</a> study:

    Various factors play a role in the virus viability such as sun light, humidity, viral load, etc. not representated in the study which in limited to its specific environment and applies only to hard surfaces.

    <p><u>Disinfectants</u><br>
    While contamination from surfaces are not a major source of infection, if needed the best household cleaners are confirmed virucidal disinfectants such as 0.05% sodium hypochlorite solution(bleach) or >70% ethanol solution.<br>Find more from an official list <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-coronavirus-covid-19">here</a>.</p>

    <p>1. Check that your product is EPA-approved</p>
    <p>2. Read the directions</p>
    <p>3. Pre-clean the surface if it is visibly dirty</p>
    <p>4. Follow the contact time</p>
    <p>5. Wear gloves and wash your hands</p>
    <p>6. Lock it up. Keep cleaners out of reach from children</p>
